# kripke on the identity thesis
## phil 132 - philosophy of mind, fall 2021

In this paper, I will briefly explain Smart’s identity thesis and Kripke’s argument against the identity thesis. I will evaluate Kripke’s argument by raising a potential objection and responding on his behalf.

Smart, in “Sensations and Brain Processes,” argues that sensations are brain processes. We can represent the statement “sensations are brain processes” as A = B, in which “are” and “=” refer to strict identity; we can call this the identity thesis. Smart’s conclusion comes from the argument that sensations cannot be correlated with brain processes because it would suggest that sensations are beyond the physical level, what he calls “nomological danglers” (61). If sensations are correlated with brain processes, then sensations would not be explainable by the laws of science, which cannot be true (61). Thus, they are not correlated, but the same. 

Kripke rejects the identity thesis, and his argument can be summarized by the following: 

1.  For any A and B, if A = B, then (A = B)N, where N represents necessity. 
    
2.  For any A and B, (A ≠ B)P, where P represents possibility. 
    
3.  Thus, A ≠ B.
    

He denies the identity thesis by appealing to the distinction between contingency and necessity. An identity theorist like Smart would argue that “sensations are brain processes” is a contingent identity, meaning that the identity could logically be false. Another way of understanding it is that while they are identical in our world, it is possible that they are not identical in another world. For example, the identity “The Beatles is the best-selling artist of all time” is contingent because it could have been that in another world, the best-selling artist was not The Beatles. 

To illustrate Kripke’s argument against contingency and the identity theory more clearly, I will use the statement “pain is C-fiber stimulation.” Let us call this statement P. Smart, given that he believes identities to be contingent, would say that statement P is a contingent identity. Kripke, however, claims that statement P, if true, would be necessarily true, not contingently true. He states that for any true identity A = B, where A and B are both rigid designators, the identity must be necessarily true. A term is a rigid designator if it designates the same object in every possible world in which that object exists. For instance, with the identity “water is H2O,” both “water” and “H2O” are rigid in that “water” cannot exist without “H2O,” and “H2O” cannot exist without “water”—the identity is necessary. This is different from “The Beatles is the best-selling artist of all time” because “The Beatles” is a rigid designator, while “the best-selling artist of all time” is a non-rigid designator. With statement P, “pain” and “C-fiber stimulation” both designate the same object in every possible world. “C-fiber stimulation” picks out the same brain state in every possible world, and “pain” picks out its referent by the property of being pain itself, its own phenomenological quality (332). Thus, both are rigid designators, and statement P, if true, is necessarily true. Kripke has now illustrated that if there is a relationship of identity between any A and B, A = B must be a necessary identity. 

Given premise (1), Kripke must now show that A = B is not necessarily true (2). He does so by first rejecting the identity theorists’ potential objection that an identity H, “heat is molecular motion,” is a contingent truth. Identity theorists would argue that identity H might not be true if we imagine a world in which heat is not molecular motion. Kripke denies this by claiming that identity theorists make the mistake of equating “heat” and “the sensation of heat.” Heat is the physical phenomenon, while the sensation of heat is the feeling. What we describe as “the sensation of heat” is not actually heat, but rather something else, and this does not mean that heat is not molecular motion (331). However, pain is the sensation of pain—the very sensation of pain is pain—while heat is not always the sensation of heat. And this results in the necessary identity “pain is the sensation of pain.” Given that pain is the sensation of pain, it is then possible that there is C-fiber stimulation but not the sensation of pain and vice versa. We can imagine worlds in which pain is not C-fiber stimulation: one world in which we have C-fiber stimulation but not the sensation of pain, and another world in which there is the sensation of pain but no C-fiber stimulation. Thus, the analogy between statements H and P cannot be made, and P is not necessarily true because it is possible that pain or the sensation of pain is not C-fiber stimulation. 

Because we can imagine possible cases in which pain is not C-fiber stimulation, it must be that pain is not C-fiber stimulation. In other words, sensations (e.g. pain) are not brain processes (e.g. C-fiber stimulation), and there is not a relationship of contingent identity or identity at all. Therefore, statement P is not true, and we have arrived at the conclusion that sensations are not brain processes.

Kripke’s rejection of the identity thesis relies on the premise that identity statements, if true, are necessarily true. If we can find a way to explain that an identity is contingent, then we can argue against Kripke’s conclusion. Take the following two premises:

1. Pain = the sensation of pain, which if true, is necessarily true.
    
2. Pain = C-fiber stimulation, which if true, is necessarily true. 
    

Combining (a) and (b), we get (c) Pain = the sensation of pain = C-fiber stimulation, and we can generalize this to A = B = C, which if true, is necessarily true. Therefore, if A = B is contingent, then B = C and A = C must also be contingent because A = B = C. This means that if we can prove that at least one of the three identities is contingently true, then we have found a way to reject Kripke’s argument for necessary identities. 

Kripke relies on the fact that identities must be necessary to conclude that pain = the sensation of pain ≠ C-fiber stimulation. A potential objection to Kripke is that (b) Pain = C-fiber stimulation is in fact a contingent identity, and this objection can be made through an appeal to a physicalist identity, in which a description for “C-fiber stimulation” is contingent. With (a) Pain = the sensation of pain, we fix “pain” with “the sensation of pain” because the essence of pain is the sensation of pain. An objector might start by fixing “C-fiber stimulation” with some description that is contingent, thus resulting in the identity of the form A = B = C = D, where C = D is the new contingent identity. One would then be able to argue that pain = C-fiber stimulation is a contingent identity. 

Let us first use water as an illustration. If water is the liquid that looks and feels a certain way, and water is H2O, then H2O is the liquid that looks and feels a certain way. So, we can say water = the liquid that looks and feels a certain way = H2O. In our world, we describe water (here, I am referring specifically to water in the identity, not H2O) by the way it looks and feels to us. We can fix a similar description to H2O: H2O = the substance that is detected through a particular mechanism in this world. One might argue that H2O is not a rigid designator because it fails to pick out the same object in every possible world—it is detected as a different substance in a separate world. Thus, if this statement is contingent, then it would be the case that water = H2O is also contingent because water = H2O = the substance that is detected through a particular mechanism in this world.

We can try to apply this line of thinking to our pain identity:

1. Pain is the sensation of pain.
    
2. Pain is C-fiber stimulation.
    
3. Thus, C-fiber stimulation is the sensation of pain. 
    

If we start from (c) and fix “C-fiber stimulation” by some other description, one might argue it is possible that the identity is contingent. In particular, it could be the case that “C-fiber stimulation” is fixed by a description that picks out different neural events in other worlds. Kripke would likely respond by saying that this is not true. When we fix a physicalist description to “C-fiber stimulation,” similar to how we fix H2O with “the substance that is detected through a particular mechanism in this world,” we would be describing C-fiber stimulation in terms of other rigid designators such as “neurotransmitters,” “thermal and neural stimuli,” “Group C nerve fiber,” etc. If a description consists of rigid designators, then the reference must also be rigid; it cannot be the case that something fixed by a description with rigid designators is a contingent identity. Thus, fixing a description to “C-fiber stimulation” would result in a necessary identity, and not a contingent one. While this potential objection does not seem to be substantial against Kripke’s thesis, Kripke could benefit from addressing this sort of potential identity and the role of rigid designators in descriptions for “C-fiber stimulation.”
