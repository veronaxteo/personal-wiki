# Notes from *The Body Keeps the Score*
Some interesting facts and favorite parts from Van Der Kolk's book. Key words & phrases are **bolded** or *italicized*, and important ideas & conclusions are labeled either "idea" or "conclusion."

## Prologue
- Methods to help trauma survivors:
	1. Top-down: talking, connecting with others, understanding, processing
	2. Medicine
	3. Bottom-up: allowing body to experience things that contradict effects of trauma

## Chapter 1: Lessons From Vietnam Veterans
- Many traumatized people (e.g. war veterans, victims of child abuse) are "more haunted by shame they feel about what they did themselves did or did not" than the suffering inflicted by others
	- Confusion about whether one was victim or willing participant --> confusion about difference between love and terror, pain and pleasure
- Immersing in passions occasionally helped victims relieve feeling of numbness
	- *Connection with book Flow*
- **Rorschach test**: to observe how people construct mental images from meaningless stimulus
- *Conclusion: trauma affects imagination*
	- Importance of imagination: an escape from our everyday routine, envision new possibilities, fires creativity, alleviates pain, enhances pleasure, enriches relationships
- Traumatized people have tendency to impose trauma on everything around them
- Diagnosing PTSD finally gave a name to those suffering
- **Psychopharmacology** - administration of drugs to alleviate mental illness
- *Conclusion: trauma leads to fundamental reorganization of way mind and brain manage perceptions. changes how and what we think, and capacity to think*

## Chapter 2: Revolutions in Understanding Mind and Brain
### Understanding Suffering
- "People can never get better without knowing what they know and feeling what they feel"
- "You can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of your body, in all its visceral dimensions"
- Medicine approaches to suffering is determined by technology available at given time
- Abnormal levels of *norepinephrine* are associated with depression, *dopamine* associated with schizophrenia

### Connecting Biology
- **Endorphins** - chemicals that brain secretes in response to stress
- *Conclusion: strong emotions can block pain. Re-exposure to stress may provide relief from anxiety.*
- **Amygdala** - cluster of brain cells that determines whether a sound, image, or sensation is perceived as a threat
- *Prozac* increases serotonin and worked well
- Psychiatric medications, although they work well, have downside in that they deflect attention from dealing with underlying issue
	- Also interfere with motivation, play, and curiosity
- *Brain-disease model* overlooks 4 truths:
	1. Restoring relationships and community is central to restoring well-being
	2. Language gives us power to change ourselves
	3. Have ability to regulate own physiology through basic activities
	4. Can change social conditions to create safe environments
	- These are important in allowing people to be a *participant rather than a patient* in healing process

## Chapter 3 - Looking Into the Brain: The Neuroscience Revolution
During trauma experiencing:
- **Limbic area** - emotional brain, amygdala
	- Right limbic area increased activity
- **Broca's area** - one of speech centers in brain
	- Significant decrease in activity; hard to put thoughts and feelings into words
- **Brodmann's area 19** - region in visual cortex that registers images when first enter brain
	- Increased brain activity
- Trauma deactivates left side of brain (linguistic, sequential, analytical) while activating right side (intuitive, emotional, visual, spatial, temporal)
- *Adrenaline* is a hormone for fight/flight

## Chapter 4 - Running For Your Life: The Anatomy of Survival
- Traumatized people can't integrated new experiences into their lives
- **mirror neurons** - specialized cells in cortex
	- pick up other people's movements and their emotional states and intentions
- in PTSD, the balance between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex shifts, which makes it harder to control emotions and impulses
- emotion is not opposed to reason
	- our emotions assign value to experiences and are the foundation of reason
- neuroscience research shows that very few psychological problems are the result of defects in understanding
	- most originate in pressures from deeper regions in brain that drive our perception and attention
- "dissociation" is the essence of trauma
-
