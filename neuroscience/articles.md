## "Why We Forget Things"

[Why We Forget Things, According to Neuroscience | Time](https://time.com/6171190/new-science-of-forgetting/)

* Research at USC of zebrafish associating light with heat
	* Both memory formation through connections between brain cells, and the disappearing of synaptic connections
    * Hints at biology of forgetting
* Until recently, neuroscientists thought that forgetting was simply a glitch in memory system
    * “Brain’s job was to gather and store information, and inability to retain or retrieve those memories was a failure of some neurological or psychological mechanism”
    * “Over the past decade, science as determined that forgetting is not just the failure of memory, but its own distinct force”
* Scott Small: “‘our neurons are endowed with a completely separate set of mechanisms … that are dedicated to active forgetting’”
* Mere existence of these neurobiological tools doesn’t prove that they’re useful (e.g. appendix)
* Researchers are exploring possibility that disruptions to forgetting could provide insights into complex psychological conditions like PTSD
* Forgetting is “‘one of the most fundamental aspects of a memory system. Without forgetting, nothing would work’”
    * Why is that? Seems hyperbolic
* With neighboring neurons are excited at same time, neurotransmitter chemicals fire across gap between ends of the neurons’ dendrites
    * This change in synapse between neurons is what makes a memory
    * For short-term memories, change is fleeting
    * The more a memory is revisited and repeated, the stronger the change becomes
* Purpose of memory is to help us make decisions
    * Without forgetting, evolutionary benefits of strong memory would become redundant
        * Memories would come up and be meaningless
* Getting rid of nonessential memory is one of the key purposes of sleep
    * Sleep → clearer mind
* Forgetting in the hippocampus is an ongoing reconfiguring of memory so that more recent and useful information is available more readily
    * To better predict future than more distant things
* Distinction between memories that have decayed beyond possibility of retrieval and “transient” forgetting (temporary inability to recall piece of learned information)
* Studies in fruit flies → dopamine is key factor in animals’ ability to learn and forget
* Neuroscience of forgetting might point to other insights
    * Ex: autism, PTSD
        * PTSD could be result of injury to forgetting function
        * Alzheimers
